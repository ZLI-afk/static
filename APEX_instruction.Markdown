# APEX: Alloy Property EXplorer using simulations

[APEX](https://github.com/deepmodeling/APEX) (Alloy Property EXplorer using simulations) is a part of [AI Square](https://aissquare.com/) project, in which we refactored the [DP-Gen](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dpgen) `auto_test` module to construct an extensible general alloy property test Python package based on the [dflow](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow) framework. It allows users to construct a variety of property-test workflows easily using different computational methods (e.g. LAMMPS, VASP, and ABACUS are supported currently).
